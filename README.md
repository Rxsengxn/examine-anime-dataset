### **Objectives:**
By processing the data, we aim to create a prediction model that identifies why certain anime are popular or if a highly-rated anime also tends to be popular.
Additionally, the project will explore whether there are genres or genre combinations that appeal more to audiences in terms of both ratings and popularity.
The goal of this data mining project is to understand user preferences and identify patterns in anime reviews by analyzing the dataset with over 35 million review entries.
Key objectives include addressing scoring imbalances, such as the tendency for users to favor the lowest scoring disproportionately and exploring the relationships between anime genres, types and other attributes.

### **Description/explanation:**

Analyzation of the anime dataset from Kaggle.com [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dbdmobile/myanimelist-dataset)
Download final_animedataset.csv and place it into the root directory of your project.

The repository consist of Jupyter notebooks that do dataprocessing and generate visualizations/graphs about some more interesting data (subjectively) to us.

We also have made user specific analysis conducted on 100k entries, where users have given ratings for different animes. And by combining those anime genres by score, you can have look into user's preferences form a genre perspective. This can be found in selge.ipynb "Look into User specific analyse". We have also tried to capture notable trends and correlations in the data using methods and

### **Problems/issues encountered:**

Computational power and data storage were significant limiting factors and one of the biggest problems we had to overcome by optimizing the computations.

### **Project structure:**

All .ipynb files in the root directory of this repository were used to analyze, (pre-)process and visualize the data.
user_analyze.csv file is used in the jako-main.ipynb file for user specific analyzations.
Most of the more relevant graphs and visualizations are in the folder "visualizations".
There is also a 2nd HW "C6_report.pdf" and our project poster "C6-poster.pdf" in the root of this repository.
